                    BINARY CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS
---------------------------------------------------------
The Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss is commonly used for binary classification problems, 
where the model predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

The BCE Loss computes the difference between the predicted probability (from the model) 
and the actual label (either 0 or 1), using the following formula:

    L = -[y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)]

Where:
    - L is the loss.
    - y is the ground truth label (either 0 or 1).
    - p is the predicted probability of the instance belonging to the positive class (i.e., the class with label 1).

The loss function outputs the average loss across all samples.

Attributes:
    output (float): The computed loss for the current batch of data.
    dinputs (ndarray): The gradient of the loss with respect to the predicted probabilities, used for backpropagation.

Methods:
    forward(y_pred, y_true):
        Computes the forward pass of the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function. This method 
        calculates the loss based on the predicted probabilities and the true labels.
        
    backward(y_pred, y_true):
        Computes the backward pass of the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function. This method 
        calculates the gradient of the loss with respect to the predicted probabilities, 
        which is used for backpropagation during training.
