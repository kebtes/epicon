"""
Multi-Class Classification of MNIST Digits (0-9) Using a Custom Neural Network

This example demonstrates how to build and train a simple feedforward neural network
from scratch to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Specifically, the
network is trained to distinguish between digits `0` through `9` (multi-class classification).

Key Steps:
----------
1. **Loading the Data**:
    - The script uses the MNIST dataset in CSV format (from `resources/mnist/`).
    - It loads both training and testing data using pandas.

2. **Preprocessing**:
    - The labels (`y_train` and `y_test`) are extracted as the first column.
    - The pixel values (`X_train`, `X_test`) are normalized to the range [0, 1].
    - One-hot encoding is applied to the labels for multi-class classification.

3. **Model Architecture**:
    - The neural network has the following architecture:
        Input (784 nodes) →
        Dense(128) + ReLU →
        Dense(64) + ReLU →
        Dense(32) + ReLU →
        Dense(10) + Softmax
    - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used for hidden layers for non-linearity.
    - Softmax is used in the output layer to produce probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

4. **Training**:
    - The model uses Categorical Cross Entropy as the loss function.
    - Gradient Descent is used as the optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01.
    - The model is trained for 100 epochs.

5. **Evaluation**:
    - After training, predictions are made on the test set.
    - The predicted class is chosen based on the highest probability from the output of the softmax.
    - The accuracy is computed and printed.

Then run the script using:
    $ python -m examples.example_2
